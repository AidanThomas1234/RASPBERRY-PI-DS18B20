This is an adaptation of a python script which would simply display the outputs from 
the DS18B20 tempature sendiner in conjuction with a raspberrypi 

This has been adapted to:
-Send outputs to a sql database 
-make a note of the date and time and input that along with the raw temp data (cent)
-using the folder names "FridgeMon" this info can then be displayed on the web and added to live graphs 

This can ensure the tempture can be monitored 
Please use the most updated branch for best use - this will be the highest number for example 04 being more up to date than 03
